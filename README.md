## Article Overview
As essential resources for studying climate change and forecasting weather, reanalysis data provide detailed and comprehensive descriptions of the Earth’s climate system. However, their generation, storage, and management are resource-intensive. For 3-hourly bivariate wind speed ensembles from the [fifth generation European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis (ERA5)](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/datasets/reanalysis-era5-single-levels?tab=overview), which face these challenges, this paper proposes an online stochastic generator (OSG). It serves as a practical surrogate to the reanalysis generation and storage, producing fast stochastic approximations while requiring storage of only a limited number of parameters. The OSG introduces two key innovations: 1) the integration of Slepian concentration, enabling efficient modeling and emulation of complex multivariate climate ensembles over any region on the globe, and 2) the incorporation of an online updating strategy, allowing data to enter the model sequentially in time blocks to update parameters, thereby reducing storage demands during construction and supporting near real-time emulation. In our case study, two OSGs are developed specifically for the Arabian-Peninsula region, using long and short blocks to accommodate different needs. Shorter blocks allow for more frequent updates and greater storage savings during construction. Emulations generated by both OSGs closely resemble the training data ensembles, as comprehensively evaluated using various indices. This work offers a promising complement to reanalysis, operable on desktop computers and supporting flexible, efficient emulations.

## Data
### Abstract
ERA5 is the fifth-generation ECMWF reanalysis, providing comprehensive and consistent descriptions of Earth’s climate and weather across atmospheric, land, and oceanic variables. The ERA5 ensemble consists of 10 members at a horizontal spatial resolution of 0.5 degree and a temporal resolution of 3 hours, representing ERA5 uncertainty through perturbed observations and model physics. This work uses 10m u- and v-component wind speed ERA5 ensembles over the Arabian Peninsula for the period 2014–2023, which were downloaded in 2024.

### Availability 
The data used in this work are in netCDF format and are available online at: https://zenodo.org/records/16618043. 

### Description
ERA5 data and ERA5 ensembles are continuously updated by incorporating new data and revising historical data to enhance their quality. Therefore, the ERA5 ensembles used in this work, downloaded in 2024, differ slightly from those currently available on the Climate Data Store (CDS) website. Although these differences are minimal, we recommend using the [2024 download](https://zenodo.org/records/16618043) to reproduce the results.

Alternatively, readers may download the latest version from the [CDS download page](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/datasets/reanalysis-era5-single-levels?tab=download). Taking the 2014 data as an example, we provide the download procedure below.
